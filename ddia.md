# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications
  - Reliability
    - prevent fault from causing failures
        - Fault: one component of system deviate from its spec
        - Failure:  stop providing required service
  - Scalabilityï¼š keep good performance when load increases
    - distribution of response time
      - median response time: how long users typically have to wait
      - other percentiles
    - horizontal/vertical scaling
    - no magic scaling sauce
  - Maintainability: operability, simplicity, and evolvability
